{-|

This module contains helpers to make Heist fit in more closely within
`Fn`'s stance against monad transformers and for regular functions.

In particular, it instantiates the Monad for HeistState to be a
StateT that contains our context, so that in the splices we can get
the context out (and modify it if needed).

Further, we add splice builders that work similar to our url
routing - splices are declared to have certain attributes of specific
types, and the splice that correspond is a function that takes those
as arguments (and takes the context and the node as well).

-- | Render interpreted templates according to the request path. Note

-- from,
--
-- > path "foo" ==> heistServe
--
-- Will match @foo\/foo\/bar@, but not @foo\/bar@. To match that, you could:
--
-- > anything ==> heistServe
--
-- This will also try the path followed by "index" if the first
-- doesn't match, so if you have @foo\/index.tpl@, the path @foo@ will
-- be matched to it.
--
-- If no template is found, this will continue routing.

-- lets us achieve this style, but the types suffer. It may be easier
